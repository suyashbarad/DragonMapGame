# DragonMapGame
This is a Dungeon maze game where the player moves and interacts using voice commands like “Go right”, “Open the door”, etc. Instead of fixed text, the game uses GPT or Gemini to generate intelligent story narration based on player actions.
# # AI-Powered Dungeon Maze Game 🎮🗣️

A voice-controlled Python dungeon game enhanced with generative AI narration. Navigate a randomly generated maze with voice commands and experience dynamic storytelling powered by Gemini or GPT.

## # Project Goal

To build an immersive dungeon game where:
- You move and interact using voice (e.g., “Go left”, “Open the door”).
- AI narrates events like enemy encounters or puzzle discoveries.
- Gameplay is saved and resumed easily.
